# What is Pickmeup?

Pickmeup is an order placing app that sends orders to your favourite stalls locally to have them ready when you arrive.

In the current environment of delivery apps such as foodpanda, grabfood and deliveroo, are really convenient and have many famous stores in your area.

However for an everyday person, you might not want to pay an extra $4 or you just want a simple meal that you're used to and spare yourself the need to choose.

That's where Pickmeup comes in, it allows you to place orders and stall owners are able to see it and prepare your order before arrival. Saving time spent outside.

  Store owners a better way to manage bulk orders.
  Customers that wants to schedule their food instead of needing to order everyday.

### Challenges
- Time
  This is due to my unfamiliarity with rails, I thought I had known how to use it that it would speed up the time it takes for me to push features but I realised halfway through that I didn't and was spending too much time just figuring out how things work instead of solving the issues.
- Heroku
  Pushing the app to heroku is a challenge in the configuration part, even after reading the documentation I couldn't get what I was doing wrong.
- Postgresql
  Because of how interdependent my tables were, trying the query for them took a long time without the help of Stuart, this project would taken longer.

### Technologies
I built the app with node.js, using only a few npms such as
- **Express**
- **Cookieparser**
- **Method-override**
- **React**
